This project is the implementation of an assignment of the course university course: Telecommunication Systems. I used the libraries numpy, scipy and matplotlib.pyplot.
The Part_1.py file is the Q-function(graphs, calculate relative squared error, and Q inversed). In the Part_2.py file are QAM waveforms.
